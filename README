  it's a recommended way to install them using GNU Stow tool.

  First, you've got to clone the repo and switch to its root directory.

    $ git clone git://github.com/ikalnitsky/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

  Second, choose the package (dotfles) you want to install and run the
  following command:

    $ stow -t ~ {package_name}

  where

      {package_name} - a package to install; for instance, bash or vim

  -> bash

     Depends on vcstatus project in order to show VCS hints in your prompt.
